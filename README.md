## Description
This is the final challenge for the UW Coding bootcamp. For this challenge, we had to follow acceptance criteria to refactor a restful api from 
starter code into a `GrapQL` api. This project utilizes `JSWT` for user authentication. `Apollo Server` & `Apollo Client` were used to connect the api 
from the server to the client. `React` was used for the front-end and `Mongo Atlas` was used for the database.
